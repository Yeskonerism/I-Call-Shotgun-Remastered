Added a user interface, one style being the original ICS interface,
and the other being representative of the ultrakill interface

Can place tiles on the Walls tilemap layer and every square that isnt
null creates an obj_solid at it, where the collision mask changes size
depending on if theres more solids below it or not

Full debug menu with different modes and a key reference list
World values mode shows all hitboxes and collision references
