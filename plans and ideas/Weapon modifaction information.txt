4 offensive mods
2 utility mods
2 tactical mods
2 risk-reward mods

Mods:
explosive rounds - self explanatory
sniper scope - allows player to move cursor to zoom in on a specific part of the map
underbarrel grenade launcher - takes up 3 mod spaces
broken magazine - 20 rounds large, allows for full on spray if the "glued trigger" mod is active, 1/20 chance to get a round to blow up in your face - does 20 damage
glued trigger - once player starts firing, they cant stop until the magazine is fully dumped
slugs - chance to stun enemies, can be melee'd to drop ammo/hp (glory kill essentially)
